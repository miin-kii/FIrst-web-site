  <h2>WEB</h2>
  <p>The World Wide Web (WWW), commonly known as the Web, is an information system enabling documents and other web resources to be accessed over the Internet.Documents and downloadable media are made available to the network through web servers and can be accessed by programs such as web browsers. Web navigation, or web surfing, is the common practice of following such hyperlinks across multiple websites. Web applications are web pages that function as application software. The information in the Web is transferred across the Internet using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).It was invented by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN in 1989 and opened to the public in 1991.</p>
